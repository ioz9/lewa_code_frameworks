<p>Android Development Tools (ADT) is a plugin for the Eclipse IDE
that is designed to give you a powerful, integrated environment in which
to build Android applications. </p>

<p>ADT extends the capabilities of Eclipse to let you quickly set up new Android
projects, create an application UI, add components based on the Android
Framework API, debug your applications using the Android SDK tools, and even
export signed (or unsigned) APKs in order to distribute your application.</p>

<p>Developing in Eclipse with ADT is highly recommended and is the fastest way
to get started. With the guided project setup it provides, as well as tools
integration, custom XML editors, and debug ouput pane, ADT gives you an
incredible boost in developing Android applications. </p>

<p>This document provides step-by-step instructions on how to download the ADT
plugin and install it into your Eclipse development environment. Note that
before you can install or use ADT, you must have compatible versions of both the
Eclipse IDE and the Android SDK installed. For details, make sure to read <a
href="#installing">Installing the ADT Plugin</a>, below. </p>

<p>If you are already using ADT, this document also provides instructions on
how to update ADT to the latest version or how to uninstall it, if necessary.
</p>

<h2 id="notes">Revisions</h2>

<p>The sections below provide notes about successive releases of
the ADT Plugin, as denoted by revision number. </p>

ADT 9.0.0</a> <em>(January 2011)</em>
  <div class="toggleme">

<dl>

<dt>Dependencies:</dt>

<dd>ADT 9.0.0 is designed for use with SDK Tools r9. If you haven't
already installed SDK Tools r9 into your SDK, use the Android SDK and AVD Manager to do
so.</dd>

<dt>General notes:</dt>
<dd>
  <ul>    
    <li>"Go To Declaration" hyperlink support: You can jump directly from code references (such as
    <code>R.id.main</code>) to the corresponding XML declaration, or from XML attributes (such as
    <code>@string</code>) to the corresponding resource definition, or from manifest XML
    registrations to activities and services.</li>
    <li>Improvements were made to name refactoring.</li>
    <li>AVDs now automatically save their state, so they can restart almost instantly. You can enable this feature when
    creating an AVD or by editing an AVD with the AVD Manager.</li> 
    <li>Improvements to the Visual Layout Editor:
      <ul>
        <li>Support for rendering targets: You can now choose an arbitrary Android platform to
        render the current page, regardless of the project's minimum platform. This makes it
        easy to verify the layout and appearance of your activity on different versions of
        the platform.
        </li>
        <li>Improved support for empty and nested layouts: Dragging items over nested and
        invisible layouts automatically enlarges and highlights these layouts, so that they
        can receive drops.
        </li>
        <li>XML formatting improvements: The editor generates cleaner XML and you can now enable
        XML auto-formatting in the <strong>Preferences</strong> menu.</li>
        <li>Improved Outline labels: The Outline tab now displays additional information about each
        View. Textual Views display a snippet of the actual text. Views with a source
        (such as ImageView) displays the resource name. Included Views display the name of the View.
        </li>
        <li>When you right click a View in the Layout Editor,
        the context menu now contains <strong>Edit ID...</strong> and <strong>Edit Text...</strong>
        items. The <strong>Properties...</strong> context menus now list all of the properties and
        provide a way to edit them
        (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/editidtextandotherpropertiesviamenu">Details</a>).
        </li>
        <li>The layout editor now properly handles
        <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/layout-resource.html#include-element"><code>&lt;include&gt;</code></a>
        and <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/layout-resource.html#merge-element"><code>&lt;merge&gt;</code></a>
        tags (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/supportforincludeandmerge">Details</a>).</li>
        <li>"Extract as Include" refactoring: The Layout Editor has a new refactoring that allows
        you to select one or more views in a layout, and extract it into a separate layout
        (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/extractasincluderefactoring">Details</a>).</li>
        <li>Improved diagnostics for class loading and rendering errors: Class loading and rendering
        error messages are more useful and provide better information about the root cause of the
        error.</li>
        <li>Improved error handling to prevent drag and reordering operations from adding children
        into an {@link android.widget.AdapterView}.</li>
        <li>Outline reordering: Reordering your views in the Outline tab is much easier
        (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/outlineimprovements">Details</a>).</li>
        <li>Fix for keybinding bug where keyboard shortcuts did not work (Issues 
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=13231">13231</a> and 
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=13134">13134</a>).</li>
        <li>Fix for problems with Custom layout attribute menu (Issue 
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=13134">13134</a>).</li>
        <li>Automatic configuration for various view types: Certain views have properties configured
        by default. For example, the width of an {@link android.widget.EditText} object is set to
        <code>match_parent</code> when added to a vertical {@link android.widget.LinearLayout}
        or a default image is added to an {@link android.widget.ImageButton}.</li>
        <li>Previews during dragging: Dragging from the palette or dragging within the layout editor
        now shows live previews of the dragged item.</li>
        <li>Navigation improvements: In the Layout Editor, double-clicking Views jumps to the
        corresponding XML element. In the Outline view, double-clicking opens the Properties view.</li>
        <li>The editor has Honeycomb style animation preview support.</li>
        <li>Improved rendering support for various Views (such as TabHosts and SlidingDrawers) in
        Honeycomb (Issues <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=3162">3162</a>
        and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=13092">13092</a>).</li>
        <li>Included layouts can be rendered and edited in the context of the layouts that include
        them. From a layout using an <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/layout-resource.html#include-element">
        <code>&lt;include&gt;</code></a> tag, double-clicking on the 
        <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/layout-resource.html#include-element">
        <code>&lt;include&gt;</code></a> element edits the referenced layout in the context of the
        current layout. Additionally, when editing a layout that is included by other layouts,
        you can quickly change between context layouts, by right clicking in the editor and choosing
        <strong>Show included in...</strong>. This feature is only available in Honeycomb.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>This release fixes many other bugs, but the most important ones are listed below:
  <ul>
   <li>Fixed issue that prevented launching debug builds on productions devices when
    <code>debuggable=true</code> was not set in the Android manifest.</li>    
    <li>The LogCat view in DDMS properly handles UTF-8 characters.</li>
    <li>The SDK Manager is more reliable on Windows
    (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/sdkmanagerfixes">Details</a>).</li>
    <li>A JUnit initialization bug that prevented you from working with JUnit tests was fixed 
    (Issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=12411">12411</a>).</li>   
  </ul>

<dt>Dependencies:</dt>

<p><p>ADT 8.0.0 is designed for use with SDK Tools r8. If you haven't
already installed SDK Tools r8 into your SDK, use the Android SDK and AVD Manager to do
so.</p></dd>

<dt>General notes:</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
  <li>New version number scheme that follows the SDK Tools revision number. The major version
number for your ADT plugin should now always match the revision number of your SDK Tools. For
example, ADT 8.x is for SDK Tools r8.</li>
  <li>Support for true debug build. You no longer need to change the value of the
   <code>debuggable</code> attribute in the Android Manifest.
  <p>Incremental builds automatically insert <code>debuggable="true"</code>, but if you perform
  "export signed/unsigned application package", ADT does <em>not</em> insert it.
  If you manually set <code>debuggable="true"</code> in the manifest file, then release builds will
  actually create a debug build (it does not remove it if you placed it there).</p></li>
  <li>Automatic <a href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/tools/proguard.html">ProGuard</a> support in
  release builds. For it to work, you need to have a <code>proguard.config</code>
  property in the <code>default.properties</code> file that points to a ProGuard config file.</li>
  <li>Completely rewritten Visual Layout Editor. (This is still a work in progress.) Now includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Full drag and drop from palette to layout for all Layout classes.</li>
      <li>Move widgets inside a Layout view, from one Layout view to another and from one layout file to another.</li>
      <li>Contextual menu with enum/flag type properties.</li>
      <li>New zoom controls.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>New HierarchyViewer plug-in integrated in Eclipse.</li>
  <li>Android launch configurations don't recompile the whole workspace on launch anymore.</li>
  <li><code>android.jar</code> source and javadoc location can now be configured.</li>

library project from other Android projects and, at build time, the tools
compile the shared code and resources as part of the dependent applications.

<h2 id="installing">Installing the ADT Plugin</h2>

<p>The sections below provide instructions on how to download and install
ADT into your Eclipse environment. If you encounter problems, see the <a
href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> section.</p>


<h3 id="preparing">Preparing Your Development Computer</h3>

<p>ADT is a plugin for the Eclipse IDE. Before you can install or use ADT,
you must have a compatible version of Eclipse installed on your development
computer. </p>

<ul>
<li>If Eclipse is already installed on your computer, make sure that it is
a version that is compatible with ADT and the Android SDK. Check the <a
href="requirements.html">System Requirements</a> document for
a list of Eclipse versions that are compatible with the Android SDK.</li>
<li>If you need to install or update Eclipse, you can download it from this
location:

<p style="margin-left:2em;"><a href=
"http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a>
</p>

<p>For Eclipse 3.5 or newer, the "Eclipse Classic" version is recommended. Otherwise, a Java or RCP
version of Eclipse is recommended.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, before you can configure or use ADT, you must install the
Android SDK starter package, as described in <a
href="installing.html#Installing">Downloading the SDK Starter Package</a>.
Specifically, you need to install a compatible version of the Android SDK Tools
and at least one development platform. To simplify ADT setup, we recommend
installing the Android SDK prior to installing ADT. </p>

<p>When your Eclipse and Android SDK environments are ready, continue with the
ADT installation as described in the steps below. </p>

<h3 id="downloading">Downloading the ADT Plugin</h3>

<p>Use Update Manager feature of your Eclipse installation to install the latest
revision of ADT on your development computer.<p>

<p>Assuming that you have a compatible version of the Eclipse IDE installed, as
described in <a href="#preparing">Preparing for Installation</a>, above, follow
these steps to download the ADT plugin and install it in your Eclipse
environment. </p>

<h3 id="configuring">Configuring the ADT Plugin</h3>

<p>Once you've successfully downloaded ADT as described above, the next step
is to modify your ADT preferences in Eclipse to point to the Android SDK directory:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Select <strong>Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences...</strong> to open the Preferences
        panel (Mac OS X: <strong>Eclipse</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>).</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Android</strong> from the left panel. </li>
    <li>For the <em>SDK Location</em> in the main panel, click <strong>Browse...</strong> and
        locate your downloaded SDK directory. </li>
    <li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Done! If you haven't encountered any problems, then the installation is
complete. If you're installing the Android SDK for the first time, return to <a
href="{@docRoot}sdk/installing.html#InstallingADT">Installing the SDK</a> to complete your setup.
</p>


<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting ADT Installation</h3>

<p> If you are having trouble downloading the ADT plugin after following the
steps above, here are some suggestions: </p>

<ul>
  <li>If Eclipse can not find the remote update site containing the ADT plugin,
try changing the remote site URL to use http, rather than https. That is, set
the Location for the remote site to:
<pre>http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/</pre></li>
<li>If you are behind a firewall (such as a corporate firewall), make sure that
you have properly configured your proxy settings in Eclipse. In Eclipse,
you can configure proxy information from the main Eclipse menu in
<strong>Window</strong> (on Mac OS X, <strong>Eclipse</strong>) &gt;
<strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Network
Connections</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p> If you are still unable to use Eclipse to download the ADT plugin as a
remote update site, you can download the ADT zip file to your local machine and
manually install it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the current ADT Plugin zip file from the table below (do not unpack it).

  <table class="download">
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Package</th>
      <th>Size</th>
      <th>MD5 Checksum</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ADT {@adtZipVersion}</td>
    <td>
      <a href="http://dl.google.com/android/{@adtZipDownload}">{@adtZipDownload}</a>
    </td>
    <td>{@adtZipBytes} bytes</td>
    <td>{@adtZipChecksum}</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</li>

</li>
  <li>Follow steps 1 and 2 in the <a href="#installing">default install
      instructions</a> (above).</li>
  <li>In the Add Site dialog, click <strong>Archive</strong>.</li>
  <li>Browse and select the downloaded zip file.</li>
  <li>Enter a name for the local update site (e.g.,
      "Android Plugin") in the "Name" field.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.
  <li>Follow the remaining procedures as listed for
      <a href="#installing">default installation</a> above,
      starting from step 4.</li>
</ol>

<p>To update your plugin once you've installed using the zip file, you will have
to follow these steps again instead of the default update instructions.</p>

<h4>Other install errors</h4>

<p>Note that there are features of ADT that require some optional
Eclipse components (for example, WST). If you encounter an error when
installing ADT, your Eclipse installion might not include these components.
For information about how to quickly add the necessary components to your
Eclipse installation, see the troubleshooting topic
<a href="{@docRoot}resources/faq/troubleshooting.html#installeclipsecomponents">ADT
Installation Error: "requires plug-in org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui"</a>.</p>

<h4>For Linux users</h4>
<p>If you encounter this error when installing the ADT Plugin for Eclipse:
<pre>
An error occurred during provisioning.
Cannot connect to keystore.
JKS</pre>
<p>
...then your development machine lacks a suitable Java VM. Installing Sun
Java 6 will resolve this issue and you can then reinstall the ADT
Plugin.</p>


<h2 id="updating">Updating the ADT Plugin</h2>

<p>From time to time, a new revision of the ADT Plugin becomes available, with
new features and bug fixes. Generally, when a new revision of ADT is available,
you should update to it as soon as convenient. </p>

<p>In some cases, a new revision of ADT will have a dependency on a specific
revision of the Android SDK Tools. If such dependencies exist, you will need to
update the SDK Tools component of the SDK after installing the new revision of
ADT. To update the SDK Tools component, use the Android SDK and AVD Manager, as
described in <a href="adding-components.html">Adding SDK Components</a>.</p>

<p>To learn about new features of each ADT revision and also any dependencies on
the SDK Tools, see the listings in the <a href="#notes">Revisions</a>
section. To determine the version currently installed, open the
Eclipse Installed Software window using <strong>Help</strong>
&gt; <strong>Software Updates</strong> and refer to the version listed for
"Android Development Tools".</p>

<p>Follow the steps below to check whether an update is available and, if so,
to install it. </p>
