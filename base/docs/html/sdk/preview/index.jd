page.title=Android 3.0 Preview SDK
@jd:body

<p>Android 3.0 is the next major release of the Android platform and is optimized for tablet
devices. We're offering a Preview SDK so you can get a head-start developing
applications for it or simply optimize your existing application for upcoming
tablets.</p>


<h3>What is the Preview SDK?</h3>

<p>The Android 3.0 Preview SDK is an early look at the upcoming version of Android 3.0, for
developers only. </p>

<p>The Preview SDK includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An early Android 3.0 system image for use in the Android emulator</li>
  <li>An Android 3.0 library with non-final APIs</li>
  <li>A new WXGA emulator skin for an extra large Android Virtual Device</li>
  <li>New documentation for Android 3.0, including a complete API reference, new developer guides,
and an API differences report between Android 3.0 and 2.3.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Be aware that:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The APIs in the Preview SDK are <strong>not final</strong>. Some APIs may change in behavior
or availability when the final SDK is made available.</li>
  <li>You <strong>cannot</strong> publish an application that's built against the Preview
SDK&mdash;you can only run an application built against the Preview SDK on the Android
emulator.</li>
  <li>The documentation on <a href="http://developer.android.com">developer.android.com</a>
does <strong>not</strong> include the Android 3.0 documentation&mdash;to read the API reference and
developer guides for Android 3.0, you must install the Android 3.0 Preview documentation from
the AVD and SDK Manager.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<p><b>About emulator performance</b></p>

<p>Because the Android emulator must simulate the ARM instruction set architecture on your
computer and the WXGA screen is significantly larger than what the emulator
normally handles, emulator performance is much slower than usual. </p>

<p>In particular, initializing the emulator can be slow and can take several
minutes, depending on your hardware. When the emulator is booting there is
limited user feedback, so please be patient and continue waiting until you see
the home screen appear. </p>

<p>We're working hard to resolve the performance issues in the emulator and it will improve in
future releases. In the meantime, we wanted to give developers access to new APIs and an basic test
environment as early as possible. </p>

<p>Keeping in mind that performance on the emulator does not reflect the speed or performance of
apps on actual devices running Android 3.0, developing and testing on the emulator is still an
important tool in evaluating your application's appearance and functionality on the new platform. 
</p>





<h3>What can I do with the preview?</h3>

<p>The Preview SDK is intended for testing existing applications on the new platform and
developing new applications with new Android 3.0 APIs.</p>

<p>If you have an existing Android application, you don't <em>have to</em> do anything. Android
applications are always forward-compatible. If your application is a good citizen of the Android
APIs, your app should work fine on devices running Android 3.0 without any additional work. However,
in order to ensure proper performance and provide users a better experience when running your
application on an Android 3.0 tablet, we recommend that you perform the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Test your application on Android 3.0</b>
    <p>Simply install the Android 3.0 preview in your Android SDK, create an AVD using the
Android 3.0 system image, install your application, and run some tests.</p>
    <p>As mentioned above, your application should perform as expected. You might, however,
discover that your activity layouts are less than ideal on a large screen or some other aspects
of your application don't behave the way you expect.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Inherit the new "Holographic" theme</b>
    <p>Android 3.0 offers an updated set of UI widgets that are redesigned for use on larger screens
such as tablets and incorporate the new holographic theme. Your existing application can inherit
the new design simply by setting the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html">{@code &lt;uses-sdk&gt;}</a>
element's {@code android:targetSdkVersion} attribute to {@code "Honeycomb"}.</p>
    <p>If you do not update the {@code android:targetSdkVersion} attribute and the {@code
android:minSdkVersion} is set to "9" or lower, then your application uses the widget designs
from Android 2.3 and does <em>not</em> inherit the holographic theme.</p>
    <p>In order for your application to match the rest of the system UI, we highly recommend you
make this change to inherit the new widget styles and system theme. However, beware that doing so
might conflict with color or text designs you applied to your application based on the previous
system theme, so you should be sure to inspect your application UI when using the holographic
theme.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Provide alternative layouts for extra large screens</b>
    <p>As discussed in the guide to <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/practices/screens_support.html">Supporting Multiple Screens</a>, Android
2.3 and above support the <code>xlarge</code> resource qualifier, which you should use to supply
alternative layouts for extra large screens.</p>
    <p>By providing alternative layouts for some of your activities when running on extra large
screens, you can improve the user experience of your application on a tablet without using any
new APIs.</p>
    <p>For example, here are some things to consider when creating a new layout for tables:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Landscape layout: The "normal" orientation for tablets is usually landscape (wide), so
you should be sure that your activities offer an appropriate layout for such a wide viewing
area.</li>
      <li>Button position: Consider whether the position of the most common buttons in your UI are
easily accessible while holding a tablet with two hands.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can add alternative resources for <em>xlarge</em>
screens without changing your {@code minSdkVersion}. For example, if you add alternative layouts in
<code>res/layout-xlarge/</code> and your application is compatible with older versions, such
as Android 1.5&mdash;which doesn't support <em>xlarge</em> screens&mdash;this layout directory is
simply ignored by those devices.</p>
  </li>
</ol>


<p>Otherwise, if you want to develop a new application or upgrade your existing application to
use APIs added in Android 3.0, we encourage you to get started by developing against the Android
3.0 preview platform. You can get started the same way as you would for any other version of
Android.</p>


<p>To get started&mdash;whether testing an existing application or creating a new one&mdash;follow
the procedure in the following section to install the Preview SDK.</p>



<h3 id="Setup">How do I get it?</h3>

<p>To get the Preview SDK, you can download it using the Android SDK and AVD Manager.</p>

<p>If you're new to Android development, start by <a href="{@docRoot}sdk/index.html">downloading the
Android SDK starter package</a>.</p>

<p><a href="{@docRoot}sdk/adding-components.html#launching">Launch the Android SDK and AVD
Manager</a> and install the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SDK Platform Android Honeycomb Preview</li>
  <li>Android SDK Tools, revision 9</li>
  <li>Android SDK Platform-tools, revision 2</li>
  <li>Documentation for Android 'Honeycomb' Preview</li>
  <li>Samples for SDK API Honeycomb Preview</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to install the documentation component for the
Honeycomb Preview SDK. The API reference for the Android 3.0 API is <strong>not</strong> available
online.</p>

<p>Once you have installed these components, open your SDK directory and navigate to {@code
docs/sdk/} and open {@code index.html} in your browser. </p>



<h3 id="Issues">Known issues</h3>

<p>The following known issues occur for Android 3.0 AVDs that are loaded in the emulator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The emulator displays a rotated portrait screen while in landscape
orientation. To view the screen correctly in landscape orientation, turn off the auto-rotate setting
in <strong>Settings > Screen > Auto-rotate screen</strong>. Then use Ctrl-F11 to rotate the
emulator.</li>
  <li>You cannot take screenshots of an emulator screen. The Device Screen Capture window displays
<strong>Screen not available</strong>.</li>
  <li>GPS emulation is currently not supported.</li>
  <li>When rotating the emulator screen by pressing Ctrl-F11, the screen turns green momentarily,
then displays the normal interface.</li>
  <li>The Dev Tools application sometimes crashes when trying to use the Package Browser
feature.</li>
</ul>
